									<p>Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves.<br><br>

</p>
									<p>
										Physics is also my most favourite subject and will be. This year, in Physics, we have learnt about Electromagnetism, Energy and Conversions, Sound and also went deep into the study of light.

											<h3>Question 1 - How The World Of Physics Works?</h3>
										</header>
										<p><i>
											<ul>
												<li>Did you realise we are able to walk and run due to <Strong>FRICTION and MOTION</strong>?</li>
												<li>Close your eyes, Hear your friends voice, And you recognize him. This is <strong>ACOUSTICS</strong>.</li>
												<li>Look around and you see different objects and people. This is <strong>LIGHT</strong>.</li>
												<li>Switch on T.V and enjoy your favourite movie. This is possible due to <strong>CURRENT ELECTRICITY</strong>.</li>
												<li>You enjoy music on speakers, due to <strong>ELECTROMAGNETISM</strong>.</i>		</li>
											</ul>

																				
										</p>
										<p>
											All the above and several other daily experiences of our lives are directly connected to the concepts of physics.
										<Br><br>	Physics is the branch of science that examines the interactions between matter and energy. This energy can take the form of motion, light, electricity, radiation gravity etc. Subatomic particles to stars and even whole galaxies are included in the scope of physics.
										</p>
										<p>
											Physics helps us to determine the cause of how the world around us functions. Physicists conducts various scientific experiments and research inorder to establish the secrets of our universe and in particular Earth. With the aid of the many technologies currently available, our contemporary society enables us to comprehend and experience these results thoroughtly. Not only is physics a part of daily life, but it is also employed in the creation of electronics, satellites and many other things and substances.

											<h3>Question 2- How Physics changed the world in past 100 years and how will it change in the next 100 years?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ul>
												
											Several Indian, Greek and Chinese philosphers have contributed immensly to several principles which in recent world are part of <strong>"PHYSICS"</strong>. Many Indian philosphers believed that every element is made up of very tiny particles called <strong>"Parmanus"</strong>. <br>
											<li><strong>The 16th and 17th centuries</strong> saw a drastic change in the evolution of physics. Nicolaus Copernicus framed the helio-centric model of our Solar System. Galelio analysed the motion of celestial bodies. Sir Issac Newton discovered several concepts pertaining to mechanics and framed the most famous 3 laws of motion and the law of Gravity.<br></li>
											
<li>In the <strong>18th century</strong> Calculus was discorvered. Bernoulli's concepts of Fluid Mechanics and several other thermodynamics related discoveries were done in this century. <br></li>
<li>the <strong>19th century</strong>, witnessed the invention of electric battery by Michael Faraday and Electric current by ampere. The famous Ohm's Law and Laws of thermodynamics were discovered during this century.<br></li>
<li>20th century gave birth to modern physics such as radiation and necleaur power Mary Curie and Pierre Curie and J.J Thompson discovered the electrons and the radioactive elements. The famous theory of relativity by Albert Einstein was during this period.</li>
											Aryabhatta through his book, Aryabhattiyam proposed the west-ward movement of Earth and also the concept of Earth spinning on its Axis. India also gave birth to several great physiscts from the contemporary world such as- Sir C.V. Raman (Raman Effect), Homibaba(Indian Neculear Program), Nambi Narayan(Indian Aerospace and Rockets), Vikram Sarabhai(Indian Space Program), Satyandra Nath Bose(Quantum Mechanics) etc.
