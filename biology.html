                                Biological science permeates every aspect of life. You are a living being and a component of biology. Therefore, biology is the subject to study if you want to learn about how a human body works or how any other living organism works. It's the greatest and most accurate technique to comprehend the environment. More than that, though, biologists play a crucial role in our ability to survive, thrive, and exist, and a career in biology has several advantages.<br>
                                Biology helps us know, understand nature<br>

                                Benefits to humans<br>

                                Role in medicine<Br>

                                The life of biology is research<br>

                                Environment and biology<br>

                                Biology helps us understand our bodies and the changes occurring in them.<br>

									<h2>Q1- How did the thematic organization of your biology topics help you see the larger picture?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Learning Biology is very important step for everyone to learn. This needs heavy amount of concentration while also understanding the topics nicely. Different topics coming at the same time can change the understanding and the perspective view of the learner. But our school had made this way lot easier.
								</p>
								<p>
									In Biology, we have learnt different things such as different systems in our body and their functions, cells, virusses and how they can affect us in different ways. Now let me tell you all what I have learnt in Biology.

									<h2>Unit 4A and 4B</h2>
                                    <h3>In this 2 units, we have learnt about-</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Different Systems and it's functions</li>
                                        <li>Cells and Cell structure</li>
                                        <li>Virusses and it's Causes</li>
                                    </ul>
								</header><br><br>
                                <h3>But now, I'm going to talk about <br>1) Human reproductive system    <br>        2) Birth, growth,& aging           <br>        3) cell and its functions            <br>        4)DNA & <br>    5)virus</h3><br><br><br>

                             
								<p>
									We learnt many things which includes different systems such as skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, urinary, and the reproductive system.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>The skeletal system works as a support structure for your body. It gives the body its shape, allows movement, makes blood cells, provides protection for organs and stores minerals. The skeletal system is also called the musculoskeletal system.</li>
										<li>The muscular system is composed of specialized cells called muscle fibers. Their predominant function is contractibility. Muscles, attached to bones or internal organs and blood vessels, are responsible for movement. Nearly all movement in the body is the result of muscle contraction.</li>
										<li> The nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord, and a complex network of nerves. This system sends messages back and forth between the brain and the body. The brain is what controls all the body's functions. The spinal cord runs from the brain down through the back.</li>
										<li>The cardiovascular system (your heart and blood vessels) supplies your body's organs with oxygen and nutrients so your organs can do their jobs. Your blood vessels also carry carbon dioxide and other waste away for disposal.</li>
									</ul>
									and many more.
