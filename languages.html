              <p>
                John Boyne's 2006 cathartic novel, The Boy in Striped Pyjamas, is a work of holocaust fiction. The story takes place during World War II, <Br>when Hitler—also known as the Fuehrer or Fury—believed that Jews were inferior to other humans and went on to establish concentration <Br>camps across Europe. Despite being a fictional novel, the story is based on actual occurrences that took place during the Holocaust. <Br>The book is written from the point of view of Bruno, a nine-year-old. The main protagonist of the novel is Bruno, who resides with his <br>parents and older sister Gretel. His innocent, naive views are very touching! He was compelled to relocate from Berlin to Auschwitz <br>due to his father's job. He is a curious, impressionable young guy who loves to explore new places and go one adventures</p><p>

However, he prefers Berlin than “Out-With” (Auschwitz). He glances out of his window and sees something appealing on the other side of <br>the fence. He comes across groups of people dressed in blue and white striped pajamas. He visits the fence as the one who enjoys <Br>exploration and meets Shmuel, a Jewish boy. Despite the fence dividing them, they form an illicit friendship. Shmuel describes his <Br>miserable life on the other side of the fence, including how he lost his father during their extermination.</p><p>
Before returning to Berlin, to assist his friend Shmuel in his search for his father, Bruno makes a commitment to cross the border once.<br> Bruno is unaware that his father serves as the commandant and is an employee of the "Fury." Bruno meets a variety of personalities along<Br> the way, including Lieutenant Kotler, Pavel, Maria, his social studies instructor, etc., and learns bits and pieces of what's happening.<Br> The remainder of the novel focuses on Bruno and Shmuel's deep bond and their search for his father. This novel is worthwhile to read even though it has a tragic conclusion. It's an effortless novel with profound feelings and significance.</p>
<br><br>

It's definitely worth the read!
              </p>
